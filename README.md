This is the modified version of Clean Swift templates v3.0.2 by me
- Added `.swiftformat` file for defining formatting rules
- Reformat codes using [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) which will read rules in `.swiftformat` file
- Remove redundant comments including header comments
- Change `: class` to `: AnyObject`
